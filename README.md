# Artificial Intelligence Python codes for solving puzzles and problems.

## NOTE

This repository was created solely to discuss the various Artificial Intelligence codes in Python that can be used to solve puzzles and problems. If you have any idea or algorithm, please feel free to update this repository as it will help all of us to grow as a community.

# 1. TIC-TAC-TOE (TWO USERS)   
   
- A basic two user playable Tic-Tac-Toe game that uses your numpad as the position markers.   
- Players take turn by turn to position their mark.   
- The game does not have a GUI as of now. It is a console version.

# 2. TIC-TAC-TOE (USER vs AI)   
   
- Instead of another user, the machine will play against you.
- Developed using basic algorithm and some Tic-Tac-Toe tricks
- I have played against it a thousand times and the highest I have gone is a DRAW.
- GIVE IT A TRY. CAN YOU BEAT IT?

# 3. 8 - PUZZLE PROBLEM   
   
- There are 9 cells arranged in a 3x3 grid. Eight of them are numbered from 1 - 8 and one is left blank (in my case, I have numbered it to 0).
- The rule of this game is to swap the blank cell with its adjacent cell and arrange the cells in ascending order (with the blank space in the last cell).   
  #### That is, convert this...

# 4. 8 - PUZZLE PROBLEM SOLVER (AI)   
   
- Uses **BEST FIRST SEARCH** to find the optimum solution.
- Heuristic function used is **MANHATTAN DISTANCE**
- Feed the 8 - puzzle problem board values and it will spit out the steps.
- Solves the problem **blazing fast!**

# 5. WATER JUG PROBLEM SOLVER (AI)  
   
- There are two water jugs :- **Jug1** and **Jug2** with their own volumes.
- Water can be poured into these **Jugs**. You cannot pour more water into the **Jugs** than the permitted volumes. But you can fill less.
- Initially both the Jugs are **emtpy**.
- A final state for the Jugs are decided. That is, how much water should be stored in **Jug1** and how much in **Jug2**.
- Our goal is to achieve the final state by using only the following permitted operations:- 
   * Fill **Jug1** completely
   * Fill **Jug2** Completely
   * Empty **Jug1**
   * Empty **Jug2**
   * Transfer water from **Jug1** to **Jug2**
   * Transfer water from **Jug2** to **Jug1**
- At any given time,  only **one operation** is allowed.
- Jugs can be filled and emptied any number of times. There is **no limit**.
